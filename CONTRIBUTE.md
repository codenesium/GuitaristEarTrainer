Add a folder in tracks with the next number. Don't worry about stepping on other people's stuff I will fix it when I merge.
Submit an mp3 of you playing your lick in mp3 format encoded at 192kbs. I use garage band. I don't care what amp you use or anything like that. Variety is good.
Just make sure the notes are clear. Heavily distorted guitar is not recommended. 
Instruments other than guitar are ok too!
Submit a Guitar Pro .gp and .gp5 file of the sheet music. Make it looks like the other ones in the repo.
Your lick should be at most 4 measures. 
4 notes is a good number for a beginner lick. 
8 notes is a good number for an intermediate lick.
Polyphonic lines will move your lick right to the advanced category so keep that in mind.
